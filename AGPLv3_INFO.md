# AGPLv3 (GNU Affero General Public License v3)

## Reasons to License Software Using **AGPLv3**:

1. **Promote Software Freedom**
   - Like GPLv3, AGPLv3 ensures the software remains free and open for all users to use, study, modify, and distribute, preserving core open-source values.

2. **Enforce Copyleft**
   - AGPLv3 enforces strong copyleft, requiring any modifications or derivative works to also be licensed under AGPLv3. This ensures that improvements to the software remain open source.

3. **Network Interaction Clause (SaaS Protection)**
   - A key reason to choose AGPLv3 is its additional protection for networked software. If the software is modified and deployed as a service (e.g., in a web application or SaaS), the provider must offer the modified source code to users. This prevents companies from exploiting open-source software without sharing their improvements.

4. **Patent Protection**
   - AGPLv3 includes patent protection, meaning distributors grant patent rights to users, helping to safeguard against patent lawsuits.

5. **Prevent Tivoisation (Anti-DRM)**
   - AGPLv3 prevents the use of DRM or hardware restrictions to block users from running modified versions of the software. This ensures that end-users maintain the ability to alter and use the software as they see fit.

6. **Foster Collaboration and Sharing**
   - By requiring any service provider using the software over a network to share their modifications, AGPLv3 fosters even more collaboration than GPLv3, ensuring community contributions are shared back.

7. **Control Over Networked Applications**
   - Developers who are particularly concerned about their software being used without reciprocation in cloud or web services may choose AGPLv3, as it ensures that even network-based use must comply with the open-source terms.

8. **Ethical and Political Reasons**
   - Developers who see software as a common good, and want to ensure that even cloud-based services respect open-source principles, may prefer the AGPLv3 for its stronger protections compared to the GPLv3.


## What does the AGPLv3 license mean?
The **GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3)** can be summarised as follows:

- **Freedom to use**: The software can be used by anyone for any purpose.

- **Freedom to study**: Users can access the source code to understand how it works.

- **Freedom to modify**: Users can modify the software and release their own versions, adhering to the license conditions.

- **Freedom to distribute**: Copies of the original software or modified versions can be distributed.

- **Copyleft requirement**: Derivative works must also be licensed under the AGPLv3, ensuring continued open-source status.

- **Patent protection**: Distributors of the software grant a patent licence to recipients, safeguarding them against patent claims.

- **Network interaction clause**: If the software is modified and used to provide services over a network, the modified source code must be made available to users of the service.

- **No additional restrictions**: Users cannot impose extra restrictions on the software, ensuring its free usage.

- **Anti-Tivoisation**: Prevents the use of hardware restrictions (like DRM) to block users from running modified versions of the software.

- **Liability and warranty disclaimer**: The software is provided without any guarantees or liability.
